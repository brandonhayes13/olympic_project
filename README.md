This project is intended to do a historical analysis of the Summer Olympics.  The analysis will answer the 3 questions below:

    1. How has the addition of new countries affected the Olympics?
    2. How has the addition of new events affected the Olympics?​
    3. Have there been more female athletes added over time?

Analysis
    
    - The Summer Olympics has steadily grown in the number of countries participating, along with the number of countries that have won at least one medal. From the start of the modern Summer Olympics in 1896 to 2020, the number of countries participating increased from 13 to 206. The percentage of countries that won at least one model compared to number of countries participating has decreased over time. In 1896, 11 out of 13 participating countries won at least one medal (~85%). In 2020, 93 out of 206 won at least one medal (~45%).
    
    -The Summer Olympics has experienced a continual increase in the variety of distinctive Olympic events.  This can be seen in the bar gragh showing the change in events compared to the prior year.  There are 18 incidents where there was increases in unique events.  The addition of new events has resulted in a wider distribution of gold medals.  This is proven when the top 5 for 1908 pie chart equated for 85.8% of gold medals for the 107 unique events.  While the top 15 for 2020 pie chart equated for 69.6% of gold medals for the 290 unique events. Countries being able to submit new events allow for more diversity in specialities that translates to more variety in countries winning. 
    
    -The Summer Olympics has continued to experience growth in the number of female athletes.  This is demonstrated by the line plot show a positive correlation of 0.93 between females and the passage of time.  It can also be seen that the percentage of female athletes has increased from 25% in 1976 to 48% in 2020.  There has been a significant push for women in olympic sports to become even with men. Increasing Number of Females Over Time: Since 1980, the number of females participating in various fields has been on the rise. This trend reflects broader societal changes. For instance, women’s representation in the olympics games has substantially increased over the past four decades. Gender Disparities in Sports Participation: In this code suggests that men dominate most sports in the Olympics, except for those where female participation is limited. While this statement is generally true, it’s essential to recognize that efforts are ongoing to promote gender equality in sports. Women’s participation has increased over time, but challenges persist. Top 10 Countries with Women’s Participation and Medal Wins: The top 10 countries with the most women’s participation are also the most successful in terms of medal wins.

Methods

    Clean the data that we gathered from csv files.  Utilize visuals to answer the questions above.  The following visuals were created:

        1. A plot line with linear regression was created by counting the total number of countries that won at least one medal each Summer Olympic.
        2. A plot line with linear regression was created by counting the total number of participating countries each Summer Olympic.
        3. Calculation for percentage of number of participating countries that won at least a medal each Summer Olympic. A plot line with linear regression of this trend was created.
        4. A bar graph that was acheived by looping the events data to create a display of the changes of total events from one Summer Olympics to the next.
        5. Two pie charts that depict the difference between distribution of gold medals between countries during those designated years.
        6. A line plot showing the growth of female athletes over time.
        7. A line plot showing the percentage of female athletes over time.
